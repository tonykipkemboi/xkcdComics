The script simply scrapes all the comics on the site and saves it to a folder within the same directory.

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tonykipkemboi/xkcdComics.git`

Install all required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally run the code: `python app.py`

Happy comicking!
